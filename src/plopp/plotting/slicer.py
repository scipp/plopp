class Slicer:
    """
    Class that slices out dimensions from the data and displays the resulting data as
    either a 1D line or a 2D image.

    Note:

    This class primarily exists to facilitate unit testing. When running unit tests, we
    are not in a Jupyter notebook, and the generated figures are not widgets that can
    be placed in the `Box` widget container at the end of the `slicer` function.
    We therefore place most of the code for creating a Slicer in this class, which is
    under unit test coverage. The thin `slicer` wrapper is not covered by unit tests.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj:
        The input data.
    keep:
        The dimensions to be kept, all remaining dimensions will be sliced. This should
        be a list of dims. If no dims are provided, the last dim will be kept in the
        case of a 2-dimensional input, while the last two dims will be kept in the case
        of higher dimensional inputs.
    autoscale:
        The behavior of the y-axis (1d plots) and color range (2d plots) limits.
        If ``auto``, the limits automatically adjusts every time the data changes.
        If ``grow``, the limits are allowed to grow with time but they do not shrink.
        If ``fixed``, the limits are fixed to the full data range and do not change
        with time.
    coords:
        If supplied, use these coords instead of the input's dimension coordinates.
    vmin:
        The minimum value of the y-axis (1d plots) or color range (2d plots).
    vmax:
        The maximum value of the y-axis (1d plots) or color range (2d plots).
    **kwargs:
        The additional arguments are forwarded to the underlying 1D or 2D figures.
